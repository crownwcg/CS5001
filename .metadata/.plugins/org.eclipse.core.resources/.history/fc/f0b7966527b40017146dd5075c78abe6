 *
 * This assignment tests your understanding basic programming
 * concepts, loops, arrays, and pointers.
 *
 * This problem is to write a function findInString() that
 * returns a pointer to the first occurrence of a string in
 * another string. See the function description for details.
 *
 * Here is an algorithm for this function:
 *
 * For each starting position in 'lookingIn', compare each
 * character in lookingFor to the corresponding character in
 * 'lookingIn'.
 *
 * If reached the end of 'lookingFor', then return the current
 * starting position in 'lookingIn, else keep comparing the
 * characters in the two arrays while they are equal.
 *
 * If not found at the current starting position in 'lookingIn',
 * try again at the next position until reaching the end  of
 * 'lookingIn' At that point, return NULL.
 *
 * Important: Do not use any functions from "string.h" to
 * implement this function.
